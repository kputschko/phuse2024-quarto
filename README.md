# Getting Started with Quarto (PP06)

Clinical reports have their own defined reporting styles, and that is well documented. But what about using Quarto Books or Quarto Documents to easily maintain metadata regarding clinical studies? This could include querying your data for quality control, keeping up-to-date listings of all the variables and variable summaries, or including interactive tables and plots to help researchers explore data for new insights. Quarto is the next generation of dynamic and repeatable reporting with R, blending code, visualizations, tables, and documentation. With the ability to create and reuse custom templates, maintaining the look and feel of clinical tables, figures, and listings has never been easier. In this poster, we will explore the transformative capabilities of Quarto with a brief introduction to the creation and use of custom templates.

# Using This Repository

This is the repository for the Phuse 2024 project. Feel free to browse the files here, view the poster I created for the conference, to read the accompanying paper, and to see the final Data Dictionary that is used as an example of how Quarto reports can be used.
